## Aim and Objectives

- **Aim:** To empower farmers through data-driven insights and technology.
  
- **Objectives:**
  1. Provide data-driven insights.
  2. Suggest crops, fertilizers, and assess soil quality.
  3. Develop a user-friendly UI for farmers.
  4. Make the platform free of cost for broader accessibility.

## System Design/Architecture

IntelliFarm Tech integrates Python and machine learning at the backend, with Streamlit serving as the GUI.

## Predicting The Crop

## System Development Approach (Technology Used)

- **Algorithm:**
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest Classifier
  - Scikit Learn
  - Matplotlib
  - NumPy and Pandas

## Analysis and Planning

Identify farmer needs, define scope, allocate resources, and set timelines.

## Data Preparation

Gather agricultural data (weather, soil, crops), clean, preprocess, and organize the data.

## Machine Learning Models

Develop crop, fertilizer, and soil analysis algorithms, train models using historical and real-time data.

## User Interface

Create a farmer-friendly Streamlit dashboard, design an intuitive navigation system.

## Testing and Deployment

Validate model accuracy through testing data, deploy the system on Azure.
